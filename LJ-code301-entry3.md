# LJ Code 301 - Entry 3
December 2, 2017

Today I spent time exploring regex. It may or may not be useful for whiteboarding exercises, but it seems very valuable for solving real world problems. Once I am more comfortable with object oriented concepts (high priority area of focus) I will focus on gaining stronger proficiency with regex pattern matching.

My last codewars challenge was solved in one condenced line of regex, and I know that to be a very basic example:
`let validateUsr = (username) => /^[a-z\d\_]{4,16}$/.test(username);`
