This article introduces the concepts of behavior driven development. Together we will configure a very basic test using the Chai framework. As I first began to dive into this field, I noticed several closely related terms and tools which pop up frequently in reference material:

Test Driven Development (TDD) - This is the approach of  developing tests prior to writing production-ready code. With this philosophy code begins with the minimal viable functions required to produce the intended output and refactoring occurs later.

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) - Combines the general techniques of TDD and uses natural language constructs (English-like sentences) to express the behavior and expected outcomes of tests.

Mocha.js - A flexible Node.js based testing framework. Mocha is a popular choice for unit and integration testing in the console and the browser.

Chai.js - A Mocha compatible assertion library, allowing for expect(), assert() and should-style assertions.
