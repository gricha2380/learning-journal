Todays focus was a UI challenge, which was relatively straight forward. Front end work is something I'm comfortable with. I began already having a good grasp on CSS and HTML, and at this point I'm also comfortable with basic javascript.Attaching the event listeners was not difficult, and making custom UI elements is something I've done on my own projects already.

The big mental challenge for me is understanding back end, so my focus will be understanding node.js, Express and SQL.
