# LJ Code 301 - Entry 5
December 7, 2017

This was my first time diving into node.js and postgres, and the first time I've configured a server. The concepts of MVC are reasonably familiar, but I've never had to actually touch anything other than the view side. It's very thrilling to be able to setup the basics of it on my own, and especially true to do so with Javascript, which I already feel comfortable in.

The introduction to SQL was also very useful. I'm familair with the basic syntax, but I've never actually put it to use until now.
